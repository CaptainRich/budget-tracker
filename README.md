## Project Objective
As an avid traveler I want to be able to track my withdrawals and deposits with or without a data/internet connection
so that my account balance is accurate when I am traveling. 

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a budget tracker application without an internet connection,

* When the user inputs an expense or deposit, then they will receive a notification that they have added an expense or deposit.

* When the user reestablishes an internet connection, then the deposits or expenses added while they were offline are added to their transaction history and their totals are updated.


## Technologies Used

* IndexedDB for offline functionality and persistence
* Service Workers
* Express.js
* MongoDB for database functionality
* Heroku for deployment
